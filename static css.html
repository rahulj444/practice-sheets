        1. Can you briefly describe your role in the current Project? What were the most challenging tasks, and how did you overcome them?
2. Why did you choose React.js for the frontend? Have you explored other frameworks like Angular or Vue.js? If yes, how do they compare?
3. What is the difference between relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky positioning in CSS? When would you use each?
4. How to implement a fully responsive navigation bar? Walk through the CSS techniques you'd apply.
5. Explain how the CSS Grid differs from Flexbox and provide an example of a situation where Grid would be preferable.
6. How does the event loop work in JavaScript? Can you explain with an example involving setTimeout and Promises?
7. Differentiate between function declarations and function expressions. When should you use one over the other?
8. What is debouncing and throttling, and why are they important in web development?
9. Explain the role of useEffect in React. Provide an example where a dependency array might cause a bug.
10. What is the difference between Redux Thunk and Redux Saga? Have you worked with any middleware in Redux?
